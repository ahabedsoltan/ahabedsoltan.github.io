I am a third year PhD student at University of California San Diego advised by [Misha Belkin](http://misha.belkin-wang.org/). My research focuses on understanding the generalization behavior of machine learning model classes and their scaling behavior. I have developed an algorithm to scale kernel methods to millions of centers, establishing a state-of-the-art method. In general, I am interested in exploring the depths of machine learning and its applications.
